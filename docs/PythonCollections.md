Str is immutable in memory. 
    'This is a string'
    "This is a string"
    "It's a good thing."
    '"Yes!", he said, "I agree!"'

Multiline String is using 3 double quotes. """
""" This is 
    a multiline
    string"""
' This is\nMultiple line\ntesting'

Multiline string can use 3 single quote. '''
 '''
... This is 3 single quotes
... testing to see whether
... it will become one line
... '''
'\nThis is 3 single quotes\ntesting to see whether\nit will become one line\n'

We can embed control character into the line
m = 'This string \nspans multiple\n lines'

so display value is different from print. 
when you do a display a vairalbe, the screen may show \\, 
but when you use print, it may only show 1 \.
